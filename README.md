# Miwok-translation-app
This is a Miwok translation app which was thought on Udacity in Multiscreen app course

The Miwok app started with a basic explanation on android studio project structure.

Following is the screenshot of how the MainActivity looks like:

We start with creating 4 new activities apart from MainActivity which are NumbersActivity, ColorsActivity, FamilyActivity, and PhrasesActivity, all 4 activities are described in the following section:

* Numbers Activity shows the translation of numbers 1 to 10.
* Colors Activity shows the translation of different colors.
* Family Activity shows the translation of different family members.
* Phrases Activity shows the translation of different English phrases. 

It starts with the use of activities in the app. After learning what activities are, the app continues with a connecting concept called as intents. Intents included Implicit as well as Explicit intents.

Next, the app uses onCLickListners for know the behavior of the app when a user clicks on a certain element in android.

Further, the app uses ArrayList to take strings from the user. ArrayList is a powerful concept in Java which can be used for multiple purposes.

Next, the app also uses concepts of Loops in Java, where if loop and for loops are used in the app.

Further, the app introduces a concept of how to properly utilize resources(memory) of an android phone so that the app consumes minimal resources and helps the Android phone to work smoothly.

Then we used ListView so that we can display multiple text views at same time. ListViews uses a concept of view recycling which helps the app to consume less memory.

Also, we used a concept of ArrayAdapter combined with ListView so that we can optimize our app with respect to memory.

Further, the app also uses a concept of adding multiple images into the app. For example, the Family Activity shows the images of the family members in respective sections.

Please refer the following Family Activity screenshot to understand how images look in Miwok app:

Next, we introduced a concept of MediaPlayer in android so that when the user clicks on a particular field for translation, the app should dictate the translation to the user.

We added mp3 files into the app which had all the Miwok translations.

Also, we learned about touch feedback in android which gives a ripple effect feedback to the user when the user clicks on a particular item.

With this, we were able to add dictation feature in our app.

Further, we converted our app from activities into fragments for a smoother experience.

The app looked like this when the fragment was added:

We used Navigation Patterns for adding the swipe effect to all the fragments which help the user to easily navigate through different fragments.

These are the screenshots of how the final app looks like:
