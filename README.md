# Miwok-translation-app
This is a Miwok translation app which was thought on Udacity in Multiscreen app course

Miwok app started with a basic explanation on android studio project structure.

Following is the screenshot of how the MainActivity looks like:

We start with creating 4 new activities apart from MainActivity which are NumbersActivity, ColorsActivity, FamilyActivity and PhrasesActivity, all 4 activities are discribed in the following section:

* Numbers Activity shows the traslation of numbers 1 to 10.
* Colors Activity shows the translation of different colors.
* Family Activity shows the translation of different family members.
* Phrases Activity shows the translation of different english phrases. 

It starts with use of activities in the app. After learning what activities are, the app continues with a connecting concept called as intents. Intents included Implicit as well as Explicit intents.

Next, the app uses onCLickListners for know the behavior of the app when a user click on a certain element in android.

Further, the app uses ArrayList to take strings from the user. ArrayList is an powerful concept in Java which can be used to multiple purposes.

Next, the app also uses concepts of Loops in Java, where if loop and for loops are used in the app.

Further, the app introduces a concept of how to properly utilize resources(memory) of an android phone so that the app consumes minimal resuorces and helps the android phone to work smoothly.

Then we used ListView so that we can display multiple textviews at same time. ListViews uses a concept of view recycling which helps the app to consume less memory.

Also, we used a concept of ArrayAdapter combined with ListView so that we can optimize our app with respect to memory.

Further, the app also uses concept of adding multiple images into app. For example, the Family Activity shows the images of the family members in respective sections.

Please refer the following Family Activity screenshot to understand how images look in Miwok app:
